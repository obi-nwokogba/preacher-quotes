# Preacher Quotes
This is an app where you can read catchy, inspired, and great quotes from some famous preachers. Some of these quotes are from books, videos, or audio sermons.

This is an app built using Express, NodeJS, MongoDB, Mongoose. This is Obi's second project as a General Assembly Software Engineering Student.

### Background Story
When I would hear a preacher make a remarkable statement in a video, I would wonder how that statement could be made discoverable and easily accessible by others. I realized that not everybody would watch that particular video, read that book, or listen to that audio. So I decided to make a site where people could share captivating quotes from preachers.
