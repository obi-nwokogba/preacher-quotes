What is your project idea?
I've decided to make a collection of Quotes of my favourite preachers. 
I'm calling it 'Preacher Quotes'. Where users can add preachers and/or quotes.

What were you working on over the weekend / how much progress have you made on your project/planning?
Over the weekend, I was catching up on homework, and getting a solid understanding of Express projects that have two or three classes of objects/Schemas intracting with each other.

What are you working on today?
Today I am still working on the boilerplate and designing the mongoDB schemas.

Are you running into any roadblocks or obstacles?
None at the moment. I think this project will turn out great!





What were you working on yesterday?
Yesterday I worked on the models, mongoose to mongoDB Schemas, and sign up page.

What are you working on today?
Today I am working on starting to populate my mongoDB collection from within the app, not using a seed data file.

When do you plan to reach certain checkpoints?
Ex: full CRUD on 1 model, complete styling, complete deployment
(also include any non-MVP related checkpoints that are important to your project)
- Full Crud on Model 1 by the end of tommorow. 
I plan to have full Create and Read on Models 1(User) and 2(Preachers) today, since it will work very logically in the app.

Are you running into any roadblocks or obstacles?
None at the moment.
