What were you working on over the weekend / how much progress have you made on your project/planning?
Over the weekend, I was catching up on homework, and getting a solid understanding of Express projects that have two or three classes of objects/Schemas intracting with each other.

What are you working on today?
Today I am still working on the boilerplate and designing the mongoDB schemas.

Are you running into any roadblocks or obstacles?
None at the moment. I think this project will turn out great!
